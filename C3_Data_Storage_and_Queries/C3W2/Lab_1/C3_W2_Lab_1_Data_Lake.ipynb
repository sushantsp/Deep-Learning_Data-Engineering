        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will work with a simple data lake that uses Amazon S3 as its primary storage. The data lake bucket contains raw JSON files that you will transform using AWS Glue ETL, and then store the processed data in the same bucket. You will finally use AWS Glue crawler to populate the Glue data catalog with metadata about your processed data, and then use Amazon Athena to query your data using SQL statements. In the optional part of the lab, you will explore the effects of compression and partitioning when storing your data in S3.\n",

The data analysts are interested in conducting trend analysis for the top products reviewed in Amazon, to inform new product development. Recently, your team acquired Amazon toy review data and product info, and stored them in a data lake bucket. You are asked to clean the data and ensure its accessibility, so that the data analysts can retrieve the data with SQL-based queries. For the initial testing phase, the team has opted to use AWS Glue ETL for the initial data cleaning, and Amazon Athena to query the data. "

By simply pointing the crawler to your data source, whether it's a database or a data lake, it will automatically scan and extract the schema information, data types, and other relevant metadata. This metadata is then organized and stored in a database table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, providing a centralized repository for understanding and managing your data assets. In this lab, you will create a crawler that will be in charge of populating the Glue Data Catalog with the newly transformed data in S3, you will be able to query the data directly from S3 using Athena in the final part.\n",

        "The Parquet format, commonly used in data lake architectures, supports various [compression codecs](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/compression/) such as Snappy, Gzip, and LZO. These codecs play a crucial role in reducing the storage space needed by Parquet files. However, they come with a trade-off: while they reduce storage costs and optimize resource utilization, they can also impact processing speeds during data ingestion, transformation, and querying. To test this with a practical example, you will store the same transformed data using three different compression options: `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY` and `GZIP`: \n",

        "- `SNAPPY`: Snappy is a fast compression/decompression library that works well with Parquet files. It provides good compression ratios and is optimized for speed. Snappy compression is often a good choice for balancing compression efficiency and query performance.\n",
        "- `GZIP`: Gzip is a widely used compression algorithm that provides high compression ratios. However, it tends to be slower in both compression and decompression compared to Snappy. Gzip compression can achieve higher levels of compression but may result in slower query performance.\n",

        "**Well done!** In this lab, you implemented a simple data lake using Amazon S3, AWS Glue ETL, Glue Crawler, and Amazon Athena. You ingested raw data into an S3 bucket, which acted as the storage layer of the data lake. You then used AWS GLUE ETL to transform and prepare the data for analysis. After that, you used the Glue Crawler to catalog the data, and then used Athena to run SQL queries directly against the data lake without the need for complex data movement or transformation. This setup allows for easy and efficient querying of data stored in S3, enabling organizations to derive valuable insights from their data assets."
