Learn all about orchestrating your data pipeline tasks. You'll identify the various orchestration tools, but will focus on Airflow -- one of the most popular and widely used tools in the field today. You'll explore the core components of Airflow, the Airflow UI, and how to create and manage DAGs using various Airflow features.

## Learning Objective 
* Explain how orchestration can be applied to a data pipeline and list its benefits
* List and interact with the core components of Airflow
* Build data pipelines with DAGs in Airflow using features such as Taskflow API, operators, XCom, variables, etc.
* Apply the best practices in building DAGs in Airflow
* Integrate data quality testing using Great Expectations in an orchestrated pipeline in Airflow
